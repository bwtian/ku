when I satrtInc write this thesisï¼ŒI plan to make approach in reproduction research.
It means any person who are interested
in my study can reproduce the results anywhere , figures, even all dissertation as desired.

Based on this idea, I followed
 the following rules:
use free and open software 
To avoid mouse click 
use cml software and script as much as I can. 

Contributions 
developed a new R package for geothermal
analysis and assessment 
proposed  a new index for geothermal assessment: CGI

proposed  a new method to detect geothermal anomalies using thermal remote sensing 

contributed to reproduction research using free and open software 

3d modeling of subsurface temperature over all Japan islands 

Calculated geothermal gradient,  conductivity,  conventionality, heat flow, geothermal resources in All Japan.
